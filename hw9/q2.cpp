// Q2 Catch the Cow
/*
Title description:
Farmer John has been informed of the location of the escaped cow and hopes to catch her immediately. He starts at 
point N (0≤N≤100,000) on the number line, and the cow is at point K (0≤K≤100,000) on the same number line. Farmer 
John has two modes of transportation: walking and teleportation.

*Walking: FJ can move from any point X to X-1 or X+1 point in one minute
*Transport: FJ can move from any point X to point 2*X in one minute.
If the cow doesn't know its pursuit and doesn't move at all, how long will it take for Farmer John to retrieve it?

Input format:
Line 1: Two integers separated by spaces: N and K.

Output format:
Line 1: The minimum time (in minutes) required for Farmer John to catch a fugitive cow.

Sample input:
5 17

Sample output:
4

Hint
Solution for sample data is: 5-10-9-18-17, thus it needs 4 minutes
